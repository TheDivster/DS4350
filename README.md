This is a machine learning library developed by Divyanshu Tripathy for
DS 4350 in the University of Utah.  
The Ensemble Learning Models are in the Ensemble Learning folder. All of the actual work is done in the jupyter notebook. Grading from that would be easiest.  
The regression work is all done in the Assignment2Regression.ipynb. When I submitted the output for stochastic gradient descent was corrupted. Refer to my pdf I turned in for what the output looked like.  
Usage of perceptron for homework 3 is in the perceptron folder in the README.md.
