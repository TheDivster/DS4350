# Homework 3
All of the work was done in Perceptron.ipynb. The work was then transferred into perceptron.py. How to call the functions
are self explanatory. The perceptron class has all three of the perceptron implementations and have the same parameters they accept.
  
The way to create the classifiers is simple. Make an instance of Perceptron, and call the appropriate classifier to train.
Weights or weight count pairs will be returned to use as a model based on the type of perceptron called.  
For each perceptron classifier, give the x variables as a matrix of type numpy.ndarray, a 1-d vector of labels of type numpy.ndarray, 
and an optional learning rate and number of epochs. The appropriate weights will be returned to use.  
If there is trouble using the code in the repository, try the google colab I worked on originally. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VqRduPWTGvPdDoB1LK-FX1_J9aPjttAB?usp=sharing.
